# FIND VARIABLE ASSIGNMENTS

This exercise consists on creating a script that will take as input python (3.8) code and detect any dangerous re-definitions of python's native functions.

I copy the tests that comes with the challenges and you can add more if you want to.

For this task i had to checkout any form of variable definition that python may accept, and gets me into a better understanding of the language.
