# Exercises

This repository is the first step for my Portfolio, I will solve challenges from LeetCode and some other sites like VanHack and Turing. The main purpose of this is training and let the recruiters check out what my code looks like. I will set test cases and I will measure how much optimized it is. Finally I will measure the time it took me to get to the first solution. After that I will take some extra time to make the code readable following best practices.

## About me

My name is Santiago Nieva, I live in Tucum√°n, Argentina,  I started learning Python in 2014 as a hobby, and is my main work tool for 4 years now. Django is my framework of choice, but have used Flask for small projects too. I use Linux (Debian forks such as Kali, Ubuntu, Elementary) for personal use for about 10 years now. I actually work at the Scientific Team for Prosecutor Investigation at the Prosecutor Office of my Town, specifically in the IT Forensic Department. We use on a daily basis software such as Cellebrite's UFED, Oxygen Forensic among others. For the last 2 years I've been in charge of the development, deployment and mantinance of a Web Application for the Scientific Team, which have accelerated court proceedings in a very efficient and secure way. I used for this task Ubuntu Server, Nginx, Django, PosgreSQL and MinIO among others open source techs. I also study Cloud Computing (AWS) in CoderHouse where I finished in the top ten students.

Now I'm looking forward for new opportunities around the globe, searching exclusively for greater challenges or optimization issues to get me into the "puzzle-solving" frame of mind. 

I do love maths.
